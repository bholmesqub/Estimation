# Common-emitter noise floor

To provide context to the frequency spectrum of the Common-Emitter amplifier in the results, this pages contains illustrations of the noise floor of the Common-Emitter amplifier. This enables further intuition about how accurate the spectrum is matched by knowing the limitations, and provides clarity about what may be signal distortion and not noise.

The same measurement script was used as for performing the circuit measurements but with input signal amplitudes set to 0. The sample rate is 1 MHz, measurement duration of 2 seconds, and 30 averages were performed.

## Supply Voltage -5V
![Supply voltage = -5V, C2 = 1uF](../../images/noise/ce-noise--5V-2.0s-1uF.png)

Measured DC offset = 24.2 µV

## Supply Voltage -9V
![Supply voltage = -9V, C2 = 1uF](../../images/noise/ce-noise--9V-2.0s-1uF.png)
Measured DC offset = 28.6 µV
